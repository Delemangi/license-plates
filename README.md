# License Plate Reader

This project uses the [following dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection). Create a `dataset` folder, and extract the contents of the dataset in that folder. The `dataset` folder should contain the `annotations` and `images` folders from the dataset. You may then run all scripts, provided that you've installed all dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
